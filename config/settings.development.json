I want my house to be a place where I can have people over, but not a place that's constantly full of people. I'm open to the idea of my roommates hosting small parties - I would just like to know about these ahead of time. I'm down to get to know each other; I'm not saying we have to be best friends, but I would like to do things like occasionally watch TV together and host cook outs for friends.

Ideally, the house would have a yard or at least a porch.

So, if you're someone that needs to have the volume on the TV up to the maximum, we might not be the best fit. With that said, I'm not going to get upset at you for making popcorn at night or watching your favorite TV show at a normal volume. I'm not a smoker and I don't want to live with smokers.
